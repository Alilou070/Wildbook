Hello!

Just a quick e-mail to let you know that the whale shark encounter that you submitted has been MATCHED to a previously identified shark in the ECOCEAN Whale Shark Photo-identification Library.

This information is important to unlock some of the mystery surrounding these highly migratory animals.


Thanks again for your input.


Sincerely,
Zaven Arzoumanian
