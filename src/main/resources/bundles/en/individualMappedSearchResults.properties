resultsNote = Individuals matching this search were sighted in these locations.
aspects = Map aspects:
displayAspectName0 = Position only

mapNote = <em>Note:</em> If you are zoomed in too far or zoom in too quickly, Google Maps may claim that it does not have the needed maps. Zoom back out, wait a few seconds to allow maps to load in the background, and then zoom in again. <br /><br />If more than one point is mapped for a matching marked individual, the map also displays chevrons to guide you from the first sighting (shown as a green icon) to each subsequent sighting over time. The chevrons do NOT represent a path of travel, just a sequential link across time.
