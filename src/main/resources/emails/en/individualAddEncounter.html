    <p>Hi Spot A Shark USA contributor,</p>
    <p>
        Exciting news! Spot A Shark USA researchers have matched the sand tiger shark
        in the photo that you submitted to a previously identified sand tiger shark. 
        This shark’s unique ‘animal ID’ is: <a href="@INDIVIDUAL_LINK@">@INDIVIDUAL_ID@</a>. 
    </p>

    <p>
        You can now search for and follow this shark on Spot A Shark USA using its ‘animal ID.’ 
        To check if this shark may still be available for adoption, <a href="ncaquariums.wildbook.org/adoptananimal.jsp">click here</a> to and search for your shark. 
        If this shark has already been adopted, there are plenty more sand tigers ready for adoption. 
    </p>

        You will receive an email notification when other citizen-scientists observe this shark.

    <p>Previously identified record: @INDIVIDUAL_ID@ (Alternate ID:
      @INDIVIDUAL_ALT_ID@)<br>
    <p>New encounter: @ENCOUNTER_ID@<br>
      <a href="@ENCOUNTER_LINK@">@ENCOUNTER_LINK@</a></p>
    <p>Thank you for your critical help with our sand tiger shark research and conservation.</p>
