SUBJECT: Encounter update: @ENCOUNTER_ID@

Hi Spot A Shark USA contributor,

Exciting news! Spot A Shark USA researchers have matched the sand tiger shark in the photo that you 
submitted to a previously identified sand tiger shark. This shark’s unique ‘animal ID’ is: @INDIVIDUAL_ID@ (Alternate ID: @INDIVIDUAL_ALT_ID@). 

You can now search for and follow this shark on Spot A Shark USA using its ‘animal ID.’ 
If this shark has already been adopted, there are plenty more sand tigers ready for adoption. 

You will receive an email notification when other citizen-scientists observe this shark. To opt out of these
emails, click ‘unsubscribe’ at the bottom of your email at any time. 

Cheers, 

Spot A Shark USA
