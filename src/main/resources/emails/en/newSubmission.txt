Dear Spot A Shark USA contributor, 

Thank you for reporting your sand tiger shark encounter. We will use your information to assist a global community of researchers and citizen scientists working to better understand and protect wildlife.

Thank you for uploading a sand tiger shark photo to Spot A Shark USA. 
Spot A Shark USA researchers will soon identify the sand tiger shark in your photo using its unique pattern of spots visible along the side. 
Once your shark has been identified by Spot A Shark USA researchers, your shark will be assigned an ‘animal ID.’ 
You will receive a follow-up email notifying you of your shark’s ‘animal ID’. Your shark will be available adoptable once it has its ‘animal ID.’ 
Before your shark has been assigned an ‘animal ID,’ the photo that you have submitted represents a sand tiger shark ‘encounter,’ 
which has been assigned a unique number that you can view here: @ENCOUNTER_LINK@.

Identifying the shark that you photographed helps us track shark movement and behavior over time. It also determines which coastal habitats sand tiger sharks use 
during their lives. Our team will use this information to answer longstanding questions about sand tiger sharks and to facilitate management decisions aimed 
towards conserving sand tiger sharks, which are critically endangered in several parts of the world. 

Cheers,
Spot A Shark USA
