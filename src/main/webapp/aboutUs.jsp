<h2>About Us</h2>


<h3>The Collaborators</h3>


<p>
In 2023, a small but passionate international collaboration came together to deliver a powerful and innovative image data management platform to support the study and conservation of carnivores.
</p>



<p>
<strong>Wild Me</strong> - a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization, staffed by a small but passionate and innovative team of technologists. Wild Me developed the carnivore-specific algorithms needed in ACW and delivered them on a powerful and easy to use image data management platform, Wildbook.  They accomplished this in less than 4 months with a relatively small training dataset, as compared to mainstream AI and computer vision projects.

<p>
<strong>Tech 4 Conservation (T4C)</strong> - a Canadian non-profit organization, acting as bridge between the research team and the technologists, funded and oversaw the creation of the African Carnivore Wildbook platform, with the intention of delivering it to accredited researchers in support of the conservation of these iconic species across Africa.
