Help us conserve, study and monitor the world's tallest mammals!

<p>
<b>GiraffeSpotter &ndash; Wildbook for Giraffe</b> is a photo-identification database of giraffe encounters and individually catalogued giraffe. The database is maintained and used by giraffe conservationists, biologists and managers to collect and analyse giraffe sighting data to learn more about population numbers and their distribution.
</p>

<p>
GiraffeSpotter uses photographs of the pattern of giraffe on both sides of their body and neck (with a focus on their right side) to distinguish between individual animals. Cutting-edge software supports rapid identification using pattern recognition and photo management tools. You too can assist with giraffe conservation research by submitting photos and sighting data. The information you submit will be used in mark-recapture studies to help with the Africa-wide conservation of these iconic animals.
