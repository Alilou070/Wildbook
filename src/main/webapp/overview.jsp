<h2>Why use African Carnivore Wildbook ?</h2>

<p>
The status of large carnivores across Africa is alarming - African Wild Dogs, Cheetahs, Leopards and Lions are all on the IUCN Red List and their populations are all declining. 
</p>
<p>
The ongoing monitoring of population size and geographic range of various threatened and endangered species are two critical factors for establishing effective, comprehensive and timely conservation plans.  Unfortunately, current population counting methods rely on disparate manual processes that are not scalable, can take years, and still result in wide ranging estimates. Regardless, the unquestioned need for population counts consumes significant time and effort by the research and conservation community, who already lack funding and resources for the specialized work that they need to do.  
</p>

<p>
Habitat preservation is a critical part of species conservation and with a comprehensive and verifiable understanding of the ranges of these critical species, legislative and policy change for habitat preservation can be accurately established and continuously monitored and modified to benefit both animal and human populations.
</p>

<p>
The vision of this Carnivore Wildbook project is to leverage innovative technology alongside a ‘crowdsourcing’ approach to ultimately enable continuous and automated population counting and geographic dispersal of these African carnivores.  This solution will also provide powerful technology platform, delivering a larger and higher quality dataset to the research and conservation communities, supporting their critical efforts to bring these species back to healthy and sustaining levels.

<h2>What does African Carnivore Wildbook  do?</h2>
<p>
 African Carnivore Wildbook uses photographs of coat and spot patterns and textures to distinguish between individual animals of each species. Identify your animalin as few as three clicks - rapid identification is achieved using pattern recognition and photo management technology. Anyone can contribute to African Carnivore Wildbook . All you need is to submit your photos and any other sighting information and African Carnivore Wildbook can do the rest. You will even be able to follow your individual animal, find out who she is friends with, where she goes, and who has seen her lately.
</p>


<h3>Researchers can manage and backup their data</h3>
<p>
Import your photos and sightings data in many common picture formats. Once imported, you can view your sightings online, follow individuals you have identified, add metadata, manage individual data, and use all the other African Carnivore Wildbook features. Having your data in African Carnivore Wildbook also serves as a free backup service for your own separate storage systems  See our <a href="#">Data Management policy here</a>.
</p>

<h3>Analysis tools</h3>
<p>African Carnivore Wildbook  provides tools for managing photoidentification, molecular sampling, and sightings databases and includes a growing number of features to help users work with additional software by linking to external programs, including ArcGIS, SOCPROG, Genepop, GenAIEx, WinBugs, and Google Earth.
