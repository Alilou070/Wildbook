<h1>Why use Amphibian and Reptile Wildbook?</h1>

<p>
        Amphibians are threatened by several factors, such as habitat fragmentation, pollution or the introduction of pathogens,
        such as BSal. Monitoring both the population size and geographic range can help to establish effective conservation
        plans. Our vision is to use innovative technology that leverages crowdsourced images to enable continuous and automated
        monitoring of the European fire salamander and other amphibians and reptiles.

</p>
<p>
        Many amphibians, such as the fire salamander or the yellow-bellied toad, carry individual specific color patterns on
        their skin, which can be used to identify individuals. This enables us to use a photographic recapture analysis to
        estimate population sizes and movement distances in a completely non-invasive way.

                                As part of the <a href="https://www.uni-bielefeld.de/biologie/crc212/">Collaborative Research Center CRC-TRR 212</a>, in which we study individualized niches, we are interested in
                                individual life performance of fire salamanders, with the ultimate goal to understand the impact of the larval habitat
                                on larval development, as well as habitat and mate choice of adults.
